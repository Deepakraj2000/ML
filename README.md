# 1.Spam Classifier with Naive Bayes

This project implements a spam classifier using the Naive Bayes algorithm. The goal is to classify messages as either 'ham' (non-spam) or 'spam' based on certain features.

## Overview

The Naive Bayes classifier is a probabilistic machine learning model that calculates the probability of a message being spam or not spam based on the frequency of words in the text. This README provides details about the implementation, evaluation metrics, and usage.

## Results

The trained model achieved the following performance metrics:

- **Accuracy:** 98.85%
